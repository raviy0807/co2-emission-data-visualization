# CO2 Emission Data Visualization


The aim of the visualization is to create awareness among the people related to CO2 Emission by
various countries of world. The report discusses the visualization process followed, and problem
faced during the implementation. It contains the steps from analysing the dataset to construction
of visualization tasks. The “CO2 Emissions from Fossil Fuels since 1751, By Nation” dataset is
used for the task. The dataset is present in datahub.io and it is prepared by Carbon Dioxide
Information Analysis Center.

## I have implemented 3 visualization to understand the CO2 Emission by various nations.

1. **Heat Map of CO2 Emission by Nation [Tableau]:** The heat map is implemented in Tableau Software. The objective is to visualize the variation in CO2 emission of various countries from 1751 to 2014.
2. **Comparison of Top 5 Country’s CO2 Emission in different form [Tableau]:** The idea is to identify the top 5 countries who spread maximum pollution by CO2 emission since 1751. Later, I thought of understanding the trend and comparing these 5 countries over 263 years starting from 1751. The comparison was performed on co2 emission by different “category of fossil fuel” (solid/liquid/gas). This visualization was also implemented in Tableau software with animation.
3. **Top 10 countries with maximum CO2 Emission after 3rd Industrial Revolution [Javascript]:** After implementing the above 2 graphs, I saw spike in CO2 emission in 19th Century and after 1950s. I was curious to know the reason and therefore, I read history channel article [1] and paper [2], which highlighted Industrial revolution to be the major cause of the increase in CO2 emission. Therefore, I created the 3rd visualization showing top 10 countries which emitted highest CO2 after 3rd Industrial Revolution.
